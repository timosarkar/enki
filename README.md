An innovative programming-language with a functional touch, built on Rubinius **wip**

## Introduction 

The Daphne programming-language is a functional, quasi-dynamic programming language based heavily on other languages such as **Io, Java, Self and Ruby**. Daphne serves an intuitive syntax, as absolute control of functionality. It features an open type-system, the ability to compile to bytecode and many many more...
 
While Daphne is still under heavy construction, the core of daphne features some neat ideas:

- inspiration from languages like Java, Io, Ruby and Self
- full object-oriented core-model
- beautiful smalltalk/self inspired rubinius frontend
- full Ruby compabillity with a low overhead
- modules done via namespaces and pure classes
- bootstrapping compiler, written 100% in Daphne
- access to any existing ruby/rubinius method

> Note: All those features were pretty likely to implement, while the core runtime is still under development. Some features listed above, are still missing.
